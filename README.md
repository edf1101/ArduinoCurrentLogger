# Arduino Current Logger

## Introduction
This is a hardware and software solution to measure variable current draws from a device.
This is useful for devices that may have different current peaks over a period of time.

It can be simply, visualised on an OLED display though it also comes with a PC graphing tool to visualise the data in more depth.
