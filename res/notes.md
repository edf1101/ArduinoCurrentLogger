# Notes
_This file contains notes/ideas for this project._

### Ideas
- Could send data over HTTP instead of serial.

### Plan
1. Create the mpl frame inside the gui that updates if you send it data. (dummy data for now)
2. Create file select, file edit and credit sub menus.
3. Get working prototype of the arduino device that just sends random data or sine wave over serial to the python code.
4. Implement saving and of the serial data, pop ups etc. Make it so u can adjust COM port, baud rate etc.
5. write actual arduino code that reads the sensor data and sends it over serial.
